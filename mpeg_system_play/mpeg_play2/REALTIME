To create a realtime MPEG-I video player that operates
on its own and without any Motif extensions, edit
the Makefile and remove the -DSYSTEM_PLAY flag.
Compile and copy to mpeg_playRT. Make sure you
put things back before you generate the true
mpeg_play2 executable. Use

mpeg_playRT -realtime file

Have fun,
