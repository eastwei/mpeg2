The Multimedia Communications Lab at Boston University is pleased to
announce the public domain release of our MPEG-I Multi-Stream System
Layer player set.

The player currently supports playback of
the system layer stream on:

        SGI Indigo/Indigo-2
        SPARCIPX with the 8KHz ULaw AMD audio device(/dev/audio)
	LINUX with a 16 bit soundcard (/dev/dsp)
	
NOTE: You can compile with the -DNONE option if you don't have an
audio device.

You will need MOTIF and SYSTEM V extensions for shared memory and
semaphores.  A user's guide is provided in postscript format in
./mpeg_system/docs.  Test streams are also provided in
./mpeg_system/streams.  Anyone interrested in adapting the program so
as to not need MOTIF should contact Jim Boucher.

Note that you really need the performance of an Indigo to playout a
system layer stream with one audio stream and one video stream well
(meaning the ability to see lips moving exactly with the audio).  An
Indigo-2 plays more streams well (of course).  Since the only LINUX
platform available was a 386/33 it was impossible to optimize
synchronization parameters for this OS. If you are running this on a
DX2 66 or better, please let us know your evaluation.

The code is available from ftp at:  /pub/code on flash.bu.edu
The file is: mpeg_system_player_v1.0.tar.Z.

As a by-product of this development, a modified mpeg_play v2.0 that
provides for the real-time playback of MPEG-I video streams was
produced.  Here, real-time means that the player adapts dynamically to
drop frames to match the number of frames passed through the player to
the frame rate given in the sequence header of the video
stream. (These are in the range 24 fps to 60 fps). To create this
executable, one just recompiles the video player without the
-DSYSTEM_PLAY switch. ANY PLATFORM that plays mpeg_play v2.0 can use
the real-time video player.

The player was designed with a Mosaic interface in mind so you can
easily add it to the set of your Mosaic file players.  

For player feedback, try James Boucher first. If all else fails

ENJOY and GOOD LUCK!!!
