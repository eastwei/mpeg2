TO DO

We ported this code to the three platforms available to us with audio
devices. Please let us know if you wish to port or have ported the
code.

The audio mixer does not provide perfectly mixed audio output to avoid
possible deadlocks with the demultiplexer.  This shortfall will be
addressed in the next version.

Several improvements to the realtime video player can and will be
realized in future versions.

Possible removal of the MOTIF requirement.

KNOWN BUGS:

The video player may give an ASSERT FAILED error if you are playing a
stream FAR FAR beyond your platform's capabilities. This is being
addressed.
