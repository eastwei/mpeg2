Mode Selector Check Box

There are four toggle buttons in the Mode Selector
check box, described as follows:

- Display Mode Selector

   This button allows you to configure the Xmcd main
   window push-buttons to either display a pictorial
   symbol on their button-faces representing the
   function, or to display text titles.

   In Text Title mode, an underscore is shown below the
   letter representing the short-cut key that can be used
   to select the push-button.  If the specified short-cut
   key does not work, try using the Shift, Ctrl, Alt or
   Meta modifier keys in combination with the indicated
   key.

- Caddy Lock Selector

   This button allows you to lock and unlock the CD caddy
   when a disc is loaded.  When locked, a disc cannot be
   ejected by pressing the Eject button on the CD-ROM
   drive itself.  This is useful to prevent someone from
   inadvertently ejecting the disc.

   The Eject button on the Xmcd main window will still
   function normally even when the caddy is locked.

   This feature may not function on certain CD-ROM
   drives, notably those that do not use a motorized
   eject mechanism.

- Repeat Mode Selector

   This button allows you to enable or disable the
   Repeat mode. When Repeat mode is enabled, Xmcd will
   do the following:

  * If normal playback is finished, Repeat mode will
    cause the playback to commence again.
  * If Shuffle playback is finished, Repeat mode will
    cause a new shuffle sequence to be generated and
    played.
  * If Program playback is finished, Repeat mode will
    play the program again.

   The repeat operation will continue indefinitely until
   the Repeat mode is disabled by selecting this button.

   To repeat a single track, enter it as the only track
   in a play program and start program playback with
   Repeat mode enabled.

- Shuffle Mode Selector

   This button allows you to enable or disable the Shuffle
   mode. When Shuffle mode is enabled, Xmcd will play all
   the tracks on the CD in non-repeating random order.

   You can enable Shuffle mode only when audio playback is
   not already in progress.  Also, Shuffle mode will
   automatically disengage when you enter Program Play
   mode or specify a track using the Keypad window.
