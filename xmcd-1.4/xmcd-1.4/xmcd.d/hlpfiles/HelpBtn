The following is an overview of some of the general
features and capabilities of Xmcd:

Xmcd is an application for the X Window System,
developed using the OSF/Motif toolkit.  It is a player
of digital audio compact discs utilizing the CD-ROM
drives connected to your computer.  The audio
line-output on your CD-ROM drive can be connected
directly to an external amplifier and speakers, or to
a sound board with a built-in mixer and amplifier.
Many CD-ROM drives also have a headphone jack and
volume control on the front panel.

Xmcd does not control a sound board, thus the mixer on
a sound board must be operated via a separate
application.

Xmcd is a full-featured CD audio utility, offering
virtually every feature that is found on standalone
"real" component stereo CD players, plus many others
not easily implementable (or usable) on such a player.
The following is a list of features supported by Xmcd:

- Standard audio functions: Stop, Play, Pause, Previous
   Track, Next Track, Previous Index, Next Index,
   Rewind and Fast forward searching with audio sample,
   Eject and On/off.

   controls.

   such as band information, lyrics, etc.
