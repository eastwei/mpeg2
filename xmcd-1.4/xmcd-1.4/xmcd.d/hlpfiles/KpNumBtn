Keypad Number Buttons

Use these buttons to enter the desired track number
to start playback from.  The numbers appear in the
Keypad Track Indicator as you enter them.  When you
have finished entering the track numbers, select the
Enter button to start the audio playback at the
designated track.

Note that you cannot jump to another track using
the keypad if program mode is in effect.  Also,
shuffle playback mode will be automatically
canceled if you use the keypad to change tracks.
