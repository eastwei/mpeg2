Balance Control Center Button

Selecting this button causes the stereo balance
control slider to move to the center setting.

The balance control will work only on CD-ROM drives
that support a software-controlled volume control
with independent settings for the two channels.
On drives not so equipped, this control should be
set to the center position.
