! CD database directories.  If a relative path name is used, then it is
! assumed to be under LIBDIR/xmcd/cddb.
! (The XMCD_DBPATH environment variable overrides this)
dbdir:	rock:jazz:blues:newage:classical:reggae:folk:country:soundtrack:misc:data

! The maximum number of CD Database directories supported.
! The valid range is 1 to 100.
maxDbdirs:		20

! CD database file permissions
dbFileMode:		0664

! Play status poll interval during audio playback. (msec)
! This should be less than 500 to get satisfactory display update
! response.
! (xmcd only)
statusPollInterval:	260

! If no disc, poll interval for disc insertion (msec)
! (xmcd only)
insertPollInterval:	2000

! When previous track/index button pressed, if this number of audio blocks
! has been played in the current track/index, then playback will start from
! the beginning of the current track/index instead of the previous one.
! (xmcd only)
previousThreshold:	100

! During FF/REW search operations, the number of audio blocks to skip
! to the next audible sample
! (xmcd only)
searchSkipBlocks:	145

! During FF/REW search operations, the amount of time to pause between
! each audio sample (msec)
! (xmcd only)
searchPauseInterval:	55

! During FF/REW search operations, after this many audio samples the
! search speed will be tripled (i.e., the searchSkipBlocks parameter is
! internally multiplied by 3).  If this parameter is set to 0, then
! no speedup will occur.
! (xmcd only)
searchSpeedUpCount:	15

! During FF/REW search operations, the percentage of the current normal
! playback volume to be used for audio samples.  This is used only if
! the volumeControlSupport device specific parameter is set to True.
! (xmcd only)
searchVolumePercent:	35

! During FF/REW search operations, the minimum volume setting for audio
! samples.  This is used only if the volumeControlSupport device specific

! on the SunOS 5.x/Solaris 2.x platform with the Volume Manager.
solaris2VolumeManager:	False

! Whether error messages are output to stderr when xmcd encounters
! errors when delivering commands to the CD-ROM drive.  You should
! only set this to False if you have a non SCSI-2 compliant CD-ROM
! drive that causes xmcd to display lots of error messages.
showScsiErrMsg:		True

! Whether verbose debug diagnostics should be generated on stderr.
debugMode:		False
