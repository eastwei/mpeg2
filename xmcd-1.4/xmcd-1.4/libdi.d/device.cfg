! capability of the CD-ROM device.  LIBDIR is the XMcd.libdir resource
! (or XMCD_LIBDIR env variable) and DEVNAME is the device node path
! basename.
!
! Users can also override some of these parameters by specifying them
! in an optional $HOME/.xmcdcfg/DEVNAME file.  Parameters that are
! labeled as "No-override" are privileged and cannot be overridden
! by the user in their private configuration files.
!
! cfgver=1	Do not remove this line.
!

! The logical drive number that you want this device to map to.  This
! number is displayed on the main window title bar.
! (No-override)
!
logicalDriveNumber:	0

! Device Interface Method: Configure xmcd/cda to control the CD-ROM device
! via one of several methods.
!
! Note:
! Changing this parameter is useful only if your xmcd/cda binary is
! compiled to support the selected method.
!
! The supported methods are:
! 0	SCSI pass-through method	(Use this for most systems)
! 1	SunOS/Linux ioctl method	(For non-SCSI CD-ROM drives on Linux)
!
! (No-override)
!
deviceInterfaceMethod:	0

! CD-ROM drive vendor code.  If your CD-ROM drive is not SCSI-2 compliant,
! this is used to specify that xmcd should issue vendor-unique commands
! rather than SCSI-2 commands.
!
! Note:
! a) Changing this parameter is useful only if your xmcd/cda binary is
!    compiled to provide vendor-unique commands support.
! b) The existence of a vendor-unique module does not imply that all
!    models of CD-ROM made by that manufacturer must use the vendor-
!    unique mode.  For example, the Toshiba XM-3301/3401 and Sony
!    CDU-541/561 are SCSI-2 compliant and should use vendor code 0.
!
! The supported codes are:
! 0	SCSI-2 standard
! 1	Chinon vendor-unique
! 2	Hitachi vendor-unique
! 3	NEC vendor-unique
! 4	Pioneer vendor-unique
! 5	Sony vendor-unique
! 6	Toshiba vendor-unique
!
! (No-override)
!
driveVendorCode:	0

! The base SCSI audio volume value that corresponds to the minimum
! setting of the volume control slider.  This is used to adjust the
! range of audio volume control.  The legal range is 0 to 255.
! This parameter is used only if volumeControlSupport is True.
! (No-override)
!
scsiAudioVolumeBase:	0

! For any given play audio command, the minimum number of audio blocks
! that must be played.  Some CD-ROM drives have a minimum limit.
! Each block represents 1/75 second of audio.
! (No-override)
!
minimumPlayBlocks:	25

! If the CD-ROM drive is SCSI-2 compliant,  this parameter specifies
! whether it supports the Play Audio (10) SCSI command.  This command
! is used only as a fallback to the Play Audio (12) and Play Audio MSF
! commands in case they fail.
! (No-override)
!
playAudio10Support:	True

! If the CD-ROM drive is SCSI-2 compliant, this parameter specifies
! whether it supports the Play Audio (12) SCSI command.  The drive
! must support one of Play Audio (12) or Play Audio MSF in order to
! be useful with xmcd.
! (No-override)
!
playAudio12Support:	False

! If the CD-ROM drive is SCSI-2 compliant, this parameter specifies
! Whether it supports the Play Audio MSF SCSI command. The drive
! must support one of Play Audio (12) or Play Audio MSF in order
! to be useful with xmcd.
! (No-override)
!
playAudioMSFSupport:	True

! If the CD-ROM drive is SCSI-2 compliant,  this parameter specifies
! Whether it supports the Play Audio Track/Index SCSI command.  This
! command must be supported in order to use the Prev Index and Next
! Index buttons.
! (No-override)
!
playAudioTISupport:	True

! Whether the CD-ROM drive supports the disc load feature of the
! Start/Stop Unit SCSI command.
! (No-override)
!
loadSupport:		False

! Whether the CD-ROM drive supports the disc eject feature of the
! Start/Stop Unit SCSI command.  If this item is False, it will also
! automatically force the caddyLockSupport parameter below to False.
! (No-override)
!
ejectSupport:		True

! Whether the block descriptor should be disabled in the
! mode sense/mode select command data.  You may need to change this
! setting to get the volume control slider to work on some SCSI-2
! CD-ROM drives.
! (No-override)
!
modeSenseSetDBD:	False

! Whether the CD-ROM drive supports setting the audio playback volume
! in software.  For SCSI-2 drives, this means the audio page (0xE) of
! the Mode Select SCSI command.  For SCSI-1 drives, this is vendor-
! unique.
! (No-override)
!
volumeControlSupport:	True

! Whether the CD-ROM drive supports setting the audio playback volume
! of the stereo channels independently.  This support is required
! for the Balance Control slider to function.  The volumeControlSupport
! parameter above must be True for this to have any effect.
! (No-override)
!
balanceControlSupport:	False

! Whether the CD-ROM drive supports setting output channel routing.
! This support is required for the channel routing selector to function.
! (No-override)
!
channelRouteSupport:	False

! If the CD-ROM drive is SCSI-2 compliant,  this parameter specifies
! whether it supports the Pause/Resume SCSI command.
! (No-override)
!
pauseResumeSupport:	True

! Whether the CD-ROM drive supports the Prevent/Allow Medium Removal
! SCSI command.  If this item is False, it will also automatically
! force the caddyLock parameter to False.
! (No-override)
!
caddyLockSupport:	True

! Whether the CD-ROM drive supports data format code 1 (CD-ROM Current
! Position Data) of the Read Subchannel SCSI command.  If this item is
! False, data format code 0 (Sub-Q Channel Data) will be used instead.
! (No-override)
!
curposFormat:		False

! Whether the CD-ROM drive fails the Test Unit Ready SCSI command
! when it is playing audio.
! (No-override)
!
noTURWhenPlaying:	False

! Select the volume control taper curve.  You may need to experiment
! with this parameter to get the smoothest range of control from the
! volume control slider. This parameter is used only if
! volumeControlSupport is True.
!
! Supported values for this parameter:
! 0	Apply a linear taper.
! 1	Apply a squared taper (Small change at low settings,
!	increasing as the slider moves toward the upper range).
! 2	Apply an inverse-squared taper (big change at low settings,
!	diminishing as the slider moves toward the upper range).
!
volumeControlTaper:	0

! Select the channel routing.  This parameter is used only if
! channelRouteSupport is True.
!
! Supported values for this parameter (0 and 1 are the audio channels on
! the CD, L and R are the output channels):
! 0	Normal stereo:	0->L, 1->R
! 1	Reverse stereo:	0->R, 1->L
! 2	Mono-L:		0->L, 0->R
! 3	Mono-R:		1->L, 1->R	
! 4	Mono-L+R:	0+1->L, 0+1->R
!
channelRoute:		0

! Whether to disable the CD-ROM drive front panel eject button when
! a disc is loaded.  Normally this should be set to True.  See also
! the caddyLockSupport and ejectSupport parameters.
caddyLock:              True

! Whether the CD should be spun-down after it is loaded.  This reduces
! wear on the drive if there won't be any audio playback activity for
! a while.
spinDownOnLoad:		True

! Whether the CD should automatically start playing when it is loaded.
! This parameter, if set to True, overrides spinDownOnLoad.
playOnLoad:		False

! Whether the CD should be automatically ejected when done playing.
! "Done" means finished playing the last track on the CD in normal
! mode, or the last track in the shuffle or program mode play sequence.
! This option is only effective if ejectSupport is True.
ejectOnDone:		False

! Whether the CD should be ejected on program exit.
! This option is only effective if ejectSupport is True.
ejectOnExit:		False

! Whether the CD should be stopped on program exit.
stopOnExit:		True

! Whether xmcd should exit when the CD is ejected.  Although this is
! a generic option, it is added primarily to make xmcd run better
! under Sun Solaris 2.x's Volume Manager.
! This option is only effective if ejectSupport is True.
!
! Note: If this parameter is set to True, then xmcd will exit after
! the CD is ejected, without the usual confirmation dialog box (as you
! would get when pressing the Quit button).
exitOnEject:		False

! Whether xmcd should close the device when the CD is ejected.
! Although this is a generic option, it is added primarily to make
! xmcd run better under Sun Solaris 2.x's Volume Manager.
! This option is only effective if ejectSupport is True.
!
! Note: If this parameter is set to True, then the device will be re-opened
! when a new CD is loaded.  The "exitOnEject" parameter takes precedence
! over this one.
closeOnEject:		False
