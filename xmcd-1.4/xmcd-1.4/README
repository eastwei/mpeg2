INTRODUCTION
------------

These are the release notes for xmcd, an X11/Motif-based CD player
utility; and for cda, a command-line driven, non-graphical CD audio
player.  Please read through this file before building, installing, or
using xmcd/cda.  You should also read the INSTALL file if you will be
compiling these applications from the source code distribution.  After
installation, you can use the man(1) or xman(1) command to read the
on-line manual entry.  The CHANGES file contains a revision log.
If you encounter a problem, please read the FAQ file first, as it may
already document a solution.

In general, binaries compiled on one OS can run on another OS under the
same group.  Thus, xmcd and cda binaries compiled on Consensys SVR4.0
should run on ESIX SVR4.0, but not on Novell UnixWare or SCO ODT.
There are some issues with shared library compatibility amongst the
different SVR4.0 vendors, so it is best to run xmcd on the same OS that
it's compiled on.

Xmcd and cda must be installed as a setuid-root program on virtually
all platforms.  This is because these utilities use the SCSI
pass-through mechanism to control the CD-ROM drive, which requires root
privilege on most systems.  Security issues have been addressed, however,
since neither application will send read/write commands to a device.
They will also refuse to send any more command to a device if the
initial inquiry shows that the device is not a CD-ROM.  Also, xmcd
changes the uid and gid to that of the real user before reading/writing
CD database files or executing external programs.

On systems that do not require super-user privilege for SCSI
pass-through, it is actually more secure to turn off the user and group
permissions of the SCSI device nodes, and make xmcd and cda setuid-root.
This prevents malicious users from writing programs that send arbitrary
commands to the devices.

An exception to the setuid-root requirement:  If you configure xmcd
and cda to operate the drive via the "SunOS/Linux ioctl method"
(see the NON-SCSI CD-ROM DRIVES section below), setuid-root privilege
is not required.

The minimum DEC Ultrix and OSF/1 OS version listed above should be
heeded.  Running xmcd and cda on earlier releases of either OS may
cause the system to crash, due to bugs in the OS.  You must create
the /dev/cam device before using xmcd/cda under Ultrix.  To do so,
type the following commands while logged in as root:

    cd /dev
    MAKEDEV cam

For DG/UX, you must configure the CD-ROM to be a user SCSI device
instead of a SCSI disk.  To do so, follow these steps:

    1) Find the line in the file /var/Build/system.<hostname> which
       represents your CD-ROM drive and change the prefix "sd" to
       "scsi".
    2) Rebuild and reboot your kernel.

The current SunOS 4.1.x run-time support is limited to systems
running the sun4c and sun4m kernels.  To find out which kernel you
have, use the "arch -k" command.  Please note it has been observed
that at least on some SunOS 4.x systems, 12-byte SCSI commands are
not properly supported by the Sun CD-ROM driver.  Thus, if you have
a SCSI-2 CD-ROM drive, be sure that the "playAudio12Support" parameter
is set to "False" in your xmcd device-specific configuration file
(such as /usr/lib/X11/xmcd/config/rsr0).  Because of this OS
limitation, the SCSI-1 Hitachi CD-ROM drives (which has all 12-byte
vendor-unique SCSI-1 audio commands) may not work under SunOS 4.1.

On Solaris 2.x platforms, you should use the virtual CD-ROM device
(such as /vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0) if the Solaris Volume Manager
(/usr/sbin/vold) is also running. You should set xmcd's
"solaris2VolumeManager" X resource and either the "closeOnEject" or
"exitOnEject" device-specific parameter to True when operating under
the Volume Manager.  If you want the Volume Manager to automatically
start xmcd when a CD is inserted, you can specify the action_workman.so
start-up program in the /etc/rmmount.conf file:

action cdrom action_workman.so /usr/local/bin/X11/xmcd

Substitute /usr/local/bin/X11 with the actual path to your xmcd
binary.  See rmmount(1M) and rmmount.conf(4) for more information.

If the Solaris Volume Manager is running, you should only use the
Eject button on the xmcd main window to eject the CD.  Do not use
the eject button on the CD-ROM drive itself.

The XMcd.ad file contains several long lines broken into separate lines
using the "\" continuation marker (in particular, the
"XMcd*someWidgetName.fontList" lines).  This has been known to cause
error messages on SGI IRIX systems.  To remedy this, remove the "\"
continuation markers and join the multiple lines back into a single
line.

Several portions of xmcd and cda were contributed by these dedicated
individuals:

    Apple A/UX port:
	Eric Rosen

    Data General DG/UX port:
	Karl Owen (owen@dg-rtp.dg.com)

    DEC Ultrix and DEC OSF/1 port:

        Tom Crawley (tomc@osi.curtin.edu.au)

    Motorola SVR4/88K port:
	Mark Scott (mscott@urbana.mot.com)

    The SunOS/Linux ioctl method code to support non-SCSI CD-ROM
    drives is based on code contributed by Peter Bauer
    (100136.3530@compuserve.com).

    Several Solaris 2.x enhancements were contributed by
    Lee Duncan (Lee.Duncan@sun.com).

    The visual mode support in cda is based on code contributed
    by Philip Le Riche (pleriche@uk03.bull.co.uk).

Although xmcd and cda should run reliably on the supported platforms
and CD hardware as noted, if you encounter a problem, please send a
report to "ti@amb.org" with detailed descriptions of the configuration
and problem symptoms.  It would also be helpful to reproduce the
problem while running either application with the -debug option, and
capture the diagnostic output.  Send the output to the author for
examination.

Better yet, send bug fixes!

See the INSTALL file for information about the required X11 and Motif
library versions and configurations, and build/install instructions.

For Copyright information, read the COPYING file.

The modular design of xmcd and cda is such that support for other UNIX
environments and CD-ROM drives can be readily added.  See the "PORTING"
file for details if you are interested in contributing to the development
effort.  Before you start a porting effort or add significant code,
contact the author to ensure that this effort isn't being duplicated
by others.

	- On-line help information.
	- Attractive, intuitive-to-use Motif user interface.
	- Device-specific configuration files to make xmcd adaptable
	  to various brands of CD-ROM drives.

Xmcd uses the Motif toolkit to achieve a pleasing appearance, such that
it actually looks and feels like a real CD player for all basic
functions, yet takes advantage of the GUI and window system to make
programming and CD database functions easy.

Currently, the cda utility offers almost the same functionality as
xmcd except the FF, REW, Sample and A->B features are not available.
Also, the CD database is read-only via cda (no updates).  In addition,
a visual mode is available that turns cda into a screen-oriented
(curses-based) CD player.


Your xmcd/cda binary should only be run on the same OS platform group
that it was compiled on.  For example, UNIX SVR4.0 binaries must
not be run on a UNIX SVR4.2 system.  Likewise, a binary compiled
on a SunOS 4.x platform cannot be used on a SunOS 5.x system.

Do not use xmcd/cda if the CD-ROM drive contains a mounted filesystem
data disc (ISO-9660, High Sierra or other formats).  Always use the
"df" or "mount" command to check if such a filesystem is mounted
before invoking the application.

Certain OS platforms will print console error messages or record error
messages in a log file if the CD device is accessed without a CD loaded
in the drive.  If you encounter this situation, the workaround is to
load a CD in the drive before starting xmcd or cda, and refrain from
leaving xmcd in the "no disc" state for an extended period of time.

Unless otherwise instructed by your OS or system hardware vendor,
it is generally a bad idea to turn off the power of the CD-ROM drive
while the operating system is running.  Cycling the power may
cause the CD-ROM drive to assert a SCSI bus reset, which is not always
gracefully handled by your system's SCSI device driver (i.e., possible
system hang or crash).  Thus, it is best to turn on the CD-ROM drive
before booting the OS, and do not turn it off until after OS shutdown.

	Other SCSI-2 compliant CD-ROM drives
	Other non-SCSI CD-ROM drives (#) (driver support required)

Units denoted with a hash symbol (#) are currently supported only on
the Linux platform.  These drives are typically used with a
proprietary interface card or a sound card.  See the "NON-SCSI CD-ROM
DRIVES" section below for details.

Units denoted with an asterisk (*) can be configured to operate in the
SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 mode (via jumpers or DIP switch).  You must configure
the xmcd software accordingly (with the LIBDIR/xmcd/config/configure.sh
program).  Depending upon the specific model, you may find that xmcd/cda
supports more features while operating in SCSI-2 mode.  See the CD-ROM
drive owner's manual for details about setting the mode.

The Chinon CDx-431 and CDx-435 drives do not support commands to
implement audio pause and resume operations.  Thus, these features
are non-functional when these drives are used with xmcd/cda.  The
CDx-525 and CDx-535 units do not have this limitation.

To avoid possible SCSI bus lock-up, never eject the disc using the
eject button on the front panel of the Hitachi CD-ROM drives while
the unit is playing audio.  Use the software eject function of xmcd/cda
instead.  Also, you may wish to adjust the searchSkipBlocks and
searchPauseInterval configuration parameters to achieve the best
audio sampling effect during xmcd's REW and FF search operations.

This release of xmcd/cda supports operating only the first disc on the
Pioneer multi-disc CD-ROM changers.  Pioneer DRM-604X units with
revisions of the firmware prior to 2403 must be configured to operate
in the SCSI-1 mode (DRM-600 emulation, via back panel DIP switches),
and xmcd/cda must be configured as if it's operating a DRM-600.  Newer
DRM-604X units (firmware version 2403 and later) can be set up to
run in SCSI-2 mode, and xmcd/cda must be set up accordingly.

The Plextor/Texel DM-x024 drive firmware should be version 1.10 or
later to avoid system lockups.  The DM-x028 drives do not have these
restrictions.

Note that even if a CD-ROM drive is marketed as SCSI-2 compliant, it
still may not implement the full set of audio-related commands that
xmcd/cda requires.

The SCSI drives listed above will work only when connected via a
proper SCSI host adapter board.  Some x86 PC platforms use SCSI
CD-ROM drives but they are connected to sound cards that use a
proprietary interface.  These may work if xmcd/cda is configured
to operate the unit as a non-SCSI drive (see below).

If you have a CD-ROM drive not listed above, I would appreciate a note
from you regarding whether it works with xmcd/cda or not.  If it works,
please send me your xmcd device-specific configuration file for this
drive (usually /usr/lib/X11/xmcd/config/NAME, where NAME is the name
of the device node name of the CD-ROM drive).  I will then add your
drive to the supported list.

Some CD-ROM drives do not function well when the SCSI host adapter
board is configured to "synchronous negotiation" mode.  Examples
of these include certain NEC and Hitachi units.  If you experience
malfunctions with xmcd/cda, check the host adapter board configuration
and try disabling the synchronous mode.  On the Adaptec AHA-1542B,
there is a single jumper that controls whether synchronous negotiation
is enabled for all devices on the SCSI bus.  On the AHA-1542C,
synchronous negotiation is configurable via the on-board setup program,
and is settable on a per-ID basis.  Please consult your SCSI host
adapter board owner's manual for information.


NON-SCSI CD-ROM DRIVES
----------------------

This release of xmcd and cda supports several non-SCSI CD-ROM drives
on the Linux platform only.  Xmcd/cda must be configured to operate
in the "SunOS/Linux ioctl method" when used with these drives (rather
than the "SCSI pass-through method").  See the "deviceInterfaceMethod"
parameter in /usr/lib/X11/xmcd/config/sr0.

The specific list of non-SCSI drives supported depends upon the
configuration of the Linux host CD-ROM driver.  The following are
descriptions of the Linux mcd, sbpcd and cdu31a drivers, currently
supplied with Linux:

    - mcd
	Several Mitsumi CD-ROMs (FX001, LU005S and others)
    - sbpcd
	The SoundBlaster Pro (Matsushita, Kotobuki, Panasonic,
	Creative Labs, Aztech) CD-ROM driver.  Supports the whole
	family of Matsushita/Kotobuki/Panasonic drives, and it
	will work with the soundcard interfaces (SB Pro, SB 16,
	Galaxy, OmniCD, SoundFX, ...) and/or with the "no-sound"
	cards (Panasonic CI-101P, LaserMate, Aztech, ...).  See
	the /usr/src/linux/drivers/block/README.sbpcd file for
	details.
    - cdu31a
	The Sony interface device driver handles Sony interface
	CDROM drives and provides a complete block-level interface
	as well as an ioctl() interface compatible with the Sun
	(as specified in <linux/cdrom.h>).  With this interface,
	CDROMs can be accessed and standard audio CDs can be
	played back normally.

An IDE/EIDE/ATAPI CD-ROM driver is included on Linux kernels
1.1.76 or later only.  Patches for earlier kernels are available
from Linux FTP sites.  IDE/EIDE/ATAPI-based CD-ROM drives must be
used with a kernel with the proper driver support.

Development is ongoing and new drivers are likely to be added
for other non-SCSI CD-ROM drives.  As long as new drivers conform
to the existing ioctl interface, xmcd/cda should work without
modifications.

See your Linux documentation about configuring a kernel to use these
drivers.

All features which are defined for the SunOS/Linux ioctl interface
are enabled in xmcd/cda regardless whether the drivers can handle it
or not, because enhancements are ongoing.

Although the SunOS/Linux ioctl method will also work with many
SCSI CD-ROM drives on the Linux, SunOS 4.1.x (Solaris 1.x) and
SunOS 5.x (Solaris 2.x) platforms, it offers less features than
the SCSI pass-through method and is thus not recommended for SCSI
drives.

OTHER INFORMATION
-----------------

Linux, SCO, UnixWare or other System V variant UNIX users on an
x86 PC-compatible platform:  If you have a sound card such as
the Adlib, Sound Blaster series, Pro Audio Spectrum, Gravis
Ultrasound, Roland MPU-401, Microsoft Sound System, etc., you
may want to look into the sound card driver package called
"VoxWare" by Hannu Savolainen (hannu@voxware.pp.fi).  This package
allows you to operate the sound card's mixer settings, amongst
many other capabilities.

I have written an X11/Motif audio mixer utility "xmmix" which
works with the VoxWare package.  Slider controls are provided
in xmmix to set the Synth, PCM, Line, CD and Microphone
input levels, the Rec Out, Rec Monitor, Speaker, and Master
output levels, and Bass/Treble settings, where applicable.
You can also use the Mute, Loudness and Stereo Enhance features
of the sound card if so equipped.

Xmcd and xmmix makes an ideal pair in your multimedia PC system.
You are invited to give xmmix a try.  Xmmix can be obtained via
anonymous FTP from the following location:

	ftp.x.org:/contrib/applications/xmmix

VoxWare anonymous FTP location:

	sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel/sound

For further information please refer to the VoxWare documentation
or contact the author of the VoxWare software.

On other platforms, please refer to your OS/platform vendor
documentation about controlling your audio hardware, if applicable.
